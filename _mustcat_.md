1. Very interesting and thought provoking content

2. Consistent and interesting layout. However, on the home page, some of the buttons are covered by the images. And the binary digits in the background made it a bit tricky to read some of the text (especially in part 3 of the topic 2 section) 

3. Good.

4. Seems pretty solid. One small (and realistically not very important) criticism though is that the way you laid out out your HTML (in terms of indentations and whatnot) isn't completely consistent which can make it a bit more difficult to read

5. Kind of difficult to judge this but you split it up into different pages so I assume that's how you delegated the tasks between members of the group
